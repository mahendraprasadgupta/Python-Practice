# Inheritance in Python

# Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class. The benefits of inheritance are: 
 

# It represents real-world relationships well.
# It provides reusability of a code. We donâ€™t have to write the same code again and again. Also, it allows us to add more features to a class without modifying it.
# It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from another class A, then all the subclasses of B would automatically inherit from class A.

# A Python program to demonstrate inheritance 
   
# Base or Super class. Note object in bracket.
# (Generally, object is made ancestor of all classes)
# In Python 3.x "class Person" is 
# equivalent to "class Person(object)"
class Person(object):
       
    # Constructor
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
   
    # To get name
    def getName(self):
        return self.name
   
    # To check if this person is an employee
    def isEmployee(self):
        return False
   
   
# Inherited or Subclass (Note Person in bracket)
class Employee(Person):
   
    # Here we return true
    def isEmployee(self):
        return True
   
# Driver code
emp = Person("Geek1")  # An Object of Person
print(emp.getName(), emp.isEmployee())
   
emp = Employee("Geek2") # An Object of Employee
print(emp.getName(), emp.isEmployee())
